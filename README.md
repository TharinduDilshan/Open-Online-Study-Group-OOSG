# Open Learn Research
## Welcome to the OpenLearnresearch project 
Hey there.. We are glad you thought of looking at our project.. But let's get to know..

* Have you ever taken a Coursera or edX course? 

* Were you able to find an exciting diverse team to study or Were you feeling lonely? 

* Did you wish you have an active community to learn?


Well, if you felt for these, you are in the right place for you. 

Openlearnresearch  is a project to build communities around massive online open courses (MOOCs) to help isolated learners get the most out of these resources.

In this project, we will build a tool for MOOC community to work as effective small groups.

In this README file we will walk you through of how you can contribute at any level.. Remember.. All we need is your passion to learn online and to make online learning an exciting team work.

## Get to know us
We are initially two people who worked together in another open source project. But after 2 years we got to know we have the passion to make online learning much better place than just consuming content. 

**Dilrukshi Gamage** is the main project lead. She is a researcher PhD student in her final year in University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. She has has started and completed around 60 MOOCs since 2012 and found  interesting gaps in open online learning. She talked those problems with her online collegue and together they formed the a team to work with Mozilla. You can find more of her - www.dilrukshigamage.com

**Mark Whiting** is a Postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University CA, USA, researching in the discipline of HCI, crowdsourcing. He is part of the leading team working closely with Dilrukshi since the day of the project inception. You can find more of him - www.whiting.me

**Hasara** is CSE undergraduate student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka who got involved to this project though Dilrukshi at the same University. Hasara is interested in ML AI and HCI. She is eager to learn more with the community and looking forward to working with all of you. You can contact Hasara at - 

## What are we doing?

### The Problem 

* Online learning in MOOCs are concentrating on information transfer, delivery of content. 
* Learners in a MOOC is isolated from other thousands of learners who learn at the same time
* How might we connect learners in a MOOC course and empower them to learn together as a diverse team? 
* How might effectively grow the learning community where they can find effective learners and teams? 
H* ow might we facilitate a larger community and a smaller community to perform in a group?

### The (a) Solution

We believe in activelearning  community working as a team. We will build a tool/ platform to effective gather learners and facilitate them to work on teams. We may call it “MOOCing with Group →  **GroupMOOC**


## What do we need?

Mainly we need 
* Design, 
* development and 
* testing team for the platform which we build from the scratch. 

Not only technical contributors but any one who is interested in online learning and have ideas to make the online learning more engaging with groups can contribute in ideas. Ideas and feedback to the models we build are more important and we value those very much. 

In the milestone we share a detail level of needs where you can jump in. 

## How can you get involved?

There are few ways you can jump in. In the technical code or non technical ideas, we value both very much.

### Technical - 
* Here is the code - Link 
* Join in by making pull requests, work on the issues created. 

### Hybrid ( Technical and non technical )
* Here are the concept maps of the platform - Link

 Contribute to -
