# Open Online Study Group (OOSG)


* Have you ever taken a Coursera or edX course? 
* Were you able to find an exciting diverse team to study with or did you feel lonely? 
* Did you wish you had an active community to learn with?

If you had any of these experiences, you are in the right place. We are building tools for MOOC communities to work as effective and supportive small groups.

## What are we doing?
### The problem 
Online learning in MOOCs focuses on the transfer of information and completing assessments. Learners in MOOCs are generally isolated from the thousands of other learners who are engaged with the course at the same time.

* How might we connect learners in a MOOC course and empower them to learn together as a diverse team? 
* How might we grow the learning community to enable finding effective learners and forming teams? 
* How might we facilitate a larger community and a smaller community to perform in a coherent group?

### Our solution

We are building a platform to gather learners and help them work in teams around courses and interests. We believe in forming an active learning community to work as a team where members support each other and collectively benefit.

So far, we have started designing this system and are implementing it with a [Discourse forum](https://www.discourse.org). We hope to use [Discourse plugins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-creating-discourse-plugins-part-1/30515) to add specific features.

## How can you get involved?
We need both learners and technical contributors. We need help in clarifying our ideas, gathering participants, and implementing the solutions we design together.

We are open to all participants and adhere to the [contributor covenant](https://github.com/iceLearn/Openlearnresearch/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Everyone is welcome to join our monthly town hall meetings - [signup](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFPjzNhwugvprYr0OSPjRONGYn34Gg6-RFxml1ht5It_SBLw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for invitations to join meeetings, and you can contribute in different ways depending on your background:

### Being a non-technical contributor
Join the conversation on our forum: (link coming soon) and join the chatroom in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Open-Learn-Research/openLearnResearch) 

* Share your experiences and challenges with MOOCs
* Help us refine our solutions and share your ideas

### Being a technical contributor
Check our open [issues](https://github.com/iceLearn/Openlearnresearch/issues). Issues tagged [mozsprint](https://github.com/iceLearn/Openlearnresearch/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amozsprint+) are especially suitable for getting started by joining the conversation, or adding a solution with a pull request.

### Being a research contributor
While we are building the learning community, we would also focus on researching 
* How online learners learn best?
* How do online learners their platforms to be design? 
* What makes online learners best connect with each other?
* Do online learners network/ connect and learn? 
* How online learners network/ connect and learn?
* Do they learn better when connected than just learning on selfphase?
