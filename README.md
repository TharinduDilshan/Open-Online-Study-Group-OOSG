# OpenLearnResearch
Welcome to OpenLearnResearch. Lets get to know each other.

* Have you ever taken a Coursera or edX course? 
* Were you able to find an exciting diverse team to study with or did you feel lonely? 
* Did you wish you have an active community to learn?

Well, if you had any of these experiences, you are in the right place. 

OpenLearnResearch is a project to build communities around massive online open courses (MOOCs) to help isolated learners get the most out of these resources.

We are building tools for MOOC communities to work as effective small groups.

In this README file we will walk you through how you can contribute at any level. All you need is passion for learning and willingness to work with a group.

## Get to know us
We were two colleagues who collaborate in another open source project and after 2 years we became interested in working to make online learning a much better place than just one for consuming content. 

* **Dilrukshi Gamage** is the project lead. She is a PhD student in her final year in University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. She has has participated in around 60 MOOCs since 2012 and found many interesting gaps in open online learning. She discussed those problems with her online colleague and together they formed the a team to work with Mozilla. You can find out more about her at her website: [www.dilrukshigamage.com](http://www.dilrukshigamage.com)
* **[Mark Whiting](http://whiting.me)** is a postdoc in computer science at Stanford focusing on HCI. 
* **Hasara Maithree** is CSE undergraduate student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka who got involved to this project though Dilrukshi. Hasara is interested in ML, AI and HCI. She is eager to learn more with the community and is looking forward to working with all of you. You can contact [Hasara on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasara-maithree/). 

## What are we doing?
### The Problem 

* Online learning in MOOCs are concentrating on information transfer, delivery of content. 
* Learners in a MOOC is isolated from other thousands of learners who learn at the same time
* How might we connect learners in a MOOC course and empower them to learn together as a diverse team? 
* How might effectively grow the learning community where they can find effective learners and teams? 
* How might we facilitate a larger community and a smaller community to perform in a group?

### The (a) Solution

We believe in active learning community working as a team. We will build a tool/ platform to effective gather learners and facilitate them to work on teams. We may call it: “MOOCing with a group” → **GroupMOOC**

## What do we need?
Not only technical contributors but anyone who is interested in online learning and have ideas to make the online learning more engaging with groups can contribute ideas. Ideas and feedback to the models we build are important, and we value them very much. 

We are also looking for help with:
* design
* development 
* testing team for the platform

Get in contact to learn about specific needs.
